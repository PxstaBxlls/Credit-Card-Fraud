# Credit-Card-Fraud
Prediction of Fraud Credit Card Transactions.
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using a Random Forest Classifier on a highly imbalanced dataset of 284,807 transactions. To address the imbalance, Random Undersampling was applied, achieving a balanced representation of classes. The model trained on this resampled data achieved an accuracy of 93.40%, while testing the default model on the original imbalanced data resulted in a higher accuracy of 97.050%. After Hyperparameter Tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize parameters like the number of estimators and maximum depth, the tuned model achieved 92.89% accuracy on resampled data and 97.5422% on the original data.

The higher accuracy on the original imbalanced data reflects the dominance of majority (non-fraudulent) transactions, where the model benefits from the imbalance to classify them more effectively, inflating accuracy metrics. In contrast, the resampled dataset introduces a balanced but more complex classification task, resulting in slightly lower accuracy. This project highlights the importance of balancing data to fairly evaluate performance and the role of hyperparameter tuning in improving fraud detection systems. Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, and Imbalanced-learn were crucial to this work.
